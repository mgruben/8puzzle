# 8puzzle 
A Java solution for the [8puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=8_puzzle) problem.

This project was completed for [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-to-algorithms).

If you're in that course or related course right now, obey all honor code requirements before viewing this code.  
I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
